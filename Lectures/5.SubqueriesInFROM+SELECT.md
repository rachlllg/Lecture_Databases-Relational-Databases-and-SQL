### Subqueries in FROM and SELECT


##### 1. Find all students where scaled GPA changed GPA by more than 1.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM (SELECT sID, sName, GPA, GPA*(sizeHS/1000.0) AS scaledGPA FROM Student) G WHERE ABS(G.scaledGPA - GPA) > 1.0;

sID  sName   GPA  scaledGPA
---  ------  ---  ---------
234  Bob     3.6  5.4      
345  Craig   3.5  1.75     
567  Edward  2.9  5.8      
678  Fay     3.8  0.76     
876  Irene   3.9  1.56     
765  Jay     2.9  4.35     
543  Craig   3.4  6.8     

*The part in () is to query all these info from Student table and return them together with the scaledGPA column and rename this new table to G. Then use the G.scaledGPA to return the scaledGPA from the new table G.*

##### 2. Find colleges with the highest GPA applicants.
SELECT cName, state (SELECT DISTINCT GPA FROM Apply, Student WHERE College.cName = Apply.cName AND Student.sID = Apply.sID AND GPA >= ALL (SELECT GPA FROM Student, Apply WHERE Student.sID = Apply.sID AND Apply.cName = College.cName)) AS GPA FROM College;

SELECT DISTINCT College.cName, state, GPA FROM College, Student, Apply WHERE College.cName = Apply.cName AND Student.sID = Apply.sID AND GPA >= ALL (SELECT GPA FROM Student, Apply WHERE Student.sID = Apply.sID AND Apply.cName = College.cName);
