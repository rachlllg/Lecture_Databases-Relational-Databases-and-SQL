# Modification Statements

*use SELECT * FROM Table; to verify the result of below queries.*


### 1. Insert new college
sqlite> INSERT INTO College VALUES ('Carnegie Mellon', 'PA', 11500);


### 2. Have all students that haven't applied anywhere apply to Carnegie Mellon CS major.
sqlite> INSERT INTO Apply SELECT sID, 'Carnegie Mellon', 'CS', NULL FROM Student WHERE sID NOT IN (SELECT sID FROM Apply);


### 3. Admit to Carnegie Mellon EE all students who were rejected in EE elsewhere.
sqlite> INSERT INTO Apply SELECT sID, 'Carnegie Mellon', 'EE', 'Y' FROM Apply WHERE major = 'EE' AND decision = 'N';


### 4. Delete all students who applied to more than 2 majors.
sqlite> DELETE FROM Student WHERE sID IN (SELECT sID FROM Apply GROUP BY sID HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT major) > 2);
sqlite> DELETE FROM Apply WHERE sID IN (SELECT sID FROM Apply GROUP BY sID HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT major) > 2);


*In some SQL environments, it is not allowed to delete from the same table queried from. In that case, create a temp table to store the information you wish to delete and then query the temp table to delete from the original table.*


### 5. Delete all colleges that didn't have CS applicants.
sqlite> DELETE FROM College WHERE cName NOT IN (SELECT cName FROM Apply WHERE major = 'CS');


### 6. Change applicants to Carnegie Mellon with GPA < 3.6 to be accepted but change to econ major.
sqlite> UPDATE Apply SET decision = 'Y', major = 'economic' WHERE cName = 'Carnegie Mellon' AND sID IN (SELECT sID FROM Student WHERE GPA < 3.6);


### 7. Turn the highest GPA EE applicants into a CSE applicant.
sqlite> UPDATE Apply SET major = 'CSE' WHERE major = 'EE' AND sID IN (SELECT sID FROM (SELECT sID, GPA FROM Student WHERE sID IN (SELECT sID FROM Apply WHERE major = 'EE')) L1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM (SELECT sID, GPA FROM Student WHERE sID IN (SELECT sID FROM Apply WHERE major = 'EE')) L2 WHERE L2.GPA > L1.GPA));

*can also use ALL operator to reach the same result*
UPDATE Apply SET major = 'CSE' WHERE major = 'EE' AND sID IN (SELECT sID FROM Student WHERE GPA >= ALL (SELECT GPA FROM Student WHERE sID IN (SELECT sID FROM Apply WHERE major = 'EE')));


### 8. Change all student GPA to the highest GPA & sizeHS to the smallest sizeHS.
sqlite> UPDATE Student SET GPA = (SELECT MAX(GPA) FROM Student), sizeHS = (SELECT MIN(sizeHS) FROM Student);


### 9. Change all decisions to YES.
sqlite> UPDATE Apply SET decision = 'Y';
