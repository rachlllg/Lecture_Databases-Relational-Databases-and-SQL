### Table Variables and Set Operators


##### 1. Match the student and the colleges they applied to.
sqlite> SELECT S.sID, sName, GPA, A.cName, enrollment FROM Student S, Apply A, College C WHERE S.sID = A.sID AND A.cName = C.cName;

sID         sName       GPA         cName       enrollment
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
123         Amy         3.9         Berkeley    36000     
123         Amy         3.9         Cornell     21000     
123         Amy         3.9         Stanford    15000     
123         Amy         3.9         Stanford    15000     
234         Bob         3.6         Berkeley    36000     
345         Craig       3.5         Cornell     21000     
345         Craig       3.5         Cornell     21000     
345         Craig       3.5         Cornell     21000     
345         Craig       3.5         MIT         10000     
678         Fay         3.8         Stanford    15000     
987         Helen       3.7         Berkeley    36000     
987         Helen       3.7         Stanford    15000     
876         Irene       3.9         MIT         10000     
876         Irene       3.9         MIT         10000     
876         Irene       3.9         Stanford    15000     
765         Jay         2.9         Cornell     21000     
765         Jay         2.9         Cornell     21000     
765         Jay         2.9         Stanford    15000     
543         Craig       3.4         MIT         10000  

*use 'S', 'C', and 'A' as table variables to replace the Student, College, and Apply schemas respectively to shorten the operation*


##### 2. To find all pairs of students who have the same GPA.
sqlite> SELECT S1.sID, S1.sName, S1.GPA, S2.sID, S2.sName, S2.GPA FROM Student S1, Student S2 WHERE S1.sID < S2.sID AND S1.GPA = S2.GPA;

sID         sName       GPA         sID         sName       GPA       
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
123         Amy         3.9         456         Doris       3.9       
123         Amy         3.9         654         Amy         3.9       
123         Amy         3.9         876         Irene       3.9       
456         Doris       3.9         654         Amy         3.9       
456         Doris       3.9         876         Irene       3.9       
567         Edward      2.9         765         Jay         2.9       
654         Amy         3.9         876         Irene       3.9       
543         Craig       3.4         789         Gary        3.4    

*the same schema can be represented with different table variables to perform comparisons on data from that schema*

*use S1.sID < S2.sID so that each student only shows up once. If we use <>, then student 123 as S1 and student 456 as S2 will show up once, and student 123 as S2 and student 456 as S1 will show up again, duplicating the result*


##### 3. To show a schema including all colleges and all students.
sqlite> SELECT cName FROM college UNION SELECT sName FROM Student;

cName     
---------- -
Amy       
Berkeley  
Bob       
Cornell   
Craig     
Doris     
Edward    
Fay       
Gary      
Helen     
Irene     
Jay       
MIT       
Stanford 

*use UNION to join the two schemas as one relation. Note that the use of UNION auto sorts and auto eliminates duplicates, use UNION ALL to show duplicates. When using UNION ALL, auto sorting is no long performed, use ORDER BY to sort if needed*


##### 3. Find students who applied to both CS and EE.
sqlite> SELECT sID FROM Apply WHERE major = 'CS' INTERSECT SELECT sID FROM Apply WHERE major = 'EE';

sID       
---------- -
123       
345  

*use INTERSECT to find the results of two queries where the results are in both queries*

**For systems where INTERSECT operator is not defined, use below command to achieve the same result**
sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT A1.sID FROM Apply A1, Apply A2 WHERE A1.sID = A2.sID AND A1.major = 'CS' AND A2.major = 'EE';

sID       
---------- - 
123       
345 


##### 4. Find students who applies to CS and did not apply to EE.
sqlite> SELECT sID FROM Apply WHERE major = 'CS' EXCEPT SELECT sID FROM Apply WHERE major = 'EE';

sID       
---------- - 
543       
876       
987 

*use EXCEPT to find the results from two queries where the results of the first query is not in the results of the second query*

**For systems where EXCEPT operator is not defined, one may attempt to use the below command to achieve the same result, but the result actually differs. See SubqueriesInWHERE Example 2 for how to achieve this without using EXCEPT**
sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT A1.sID FROM Apply A1, Apply A2 WHERE A1.sID = A2.sID AND A1.major = 'CS' AND A2.major <> 'EE';

sID       
---------- -
123       
345       
987       
876       
543 

*In the example above, student 123 and 345 applied to both CS and EE showed up in the result even though it appears that should have been eliminated. Based on the logic, we are looking for student to applied to CS in A1 and student who didn't apply to EE in A2, but student who applied to CS in A1 and student who applied to CS in A2 (not EE) also matches the criteria, ie, 123 and 345. Hence, this approach is logically flawed and incorrect*
