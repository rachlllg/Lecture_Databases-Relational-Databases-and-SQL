### NULL


To demonstrate NULL values, we add below students to the Student schema.
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (432, 'Kevin', NULL, 1500);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (321, 'Lori', NULL, 2500);


##### 1. Find students whose GPA > 3.5 or <= 3.5.
sqlite> SELECT sID, sName, GPA FROM Student WHERE GPA > 3.5 OR GPA <= 3.5;

sID  sName   GPA
---  ------  ---
123  Amy     3.9
234  Bob     3.6
345  Craig   3.5
456  Doris   3.9
567  Edward  2.9
678  Fay     3.8
789  Gary    3.4
987  Helen   3.7
876  Irene   3.9
765  Jay     2.9
654  Amy     3.9
543  Craig   3.4

*Even though the query seem it should return ALL students, as seen in the result, Kevin and Lori whose GPAs are NULL in the database is not returned as part of the results. This is because NULL value is neither above or equal to or below 3.5, always be mindful of NULL when using similar queries as NULL cannot be compared to values.*


##### 2. Find the number of Students whose GPA is not unknown.
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Student WHERE GPA IS NOT NULL;

COUNT(*)
-------- -
12    


##### 3. Find the number of distinct GPAs.
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT GPA) FROM Student;

COUNT(DISTINCT GPA)
------------------- - 
7     

*NOTE that NULL is not included as part of the COUNT operator. Use below query to find all the distinct GPAs and there are 8 including NULL.*
sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT GPA FROM Student;

GPA
--- -
3.9
3.6
3.5
2.9
3.8
3.4
3.7
NULL (represented by blank row in the query result)
